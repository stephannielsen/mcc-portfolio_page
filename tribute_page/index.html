                    <dt>Until today</dt>
                    <dd>The book has become a universal representation of the time which is widely used in education around the world.</dd>
                    <dt>1955,1959</dt>
                    <dd>In 1955, the diary was adapted as play in New York, being followed by a film adapation in 1959.</dd>
                    <dt>1947-1952</dt>
                    <dd>Otto Frank pursued the release of Anne's diary as a book but was unsuccessful until it got finally released in 1947 in the Netherlands, being followed by further publications in France, Germany as well as US and Japan. After that it soon became a world wide success.</dd>
                    <dt>Apr 1945</dt>
                    <dd>British troops freed the Auschwitz camp on April 15th.

                    <dd>Anne Frank died in February or March (exact date is unknown) in the KZ Auschwitz, most probably because of some illness. Her mother died of starvation, her sister was taken by illness as well. Only her father survived.</dd>
                    <dt>Aug 1944</dt>
                    <dd>On August 4th, the Achterhuis was stormed by Gestapo and SS, following a tip from an until now unidentified source. All three families were arrested and held as criminals before being deported to transition camps and further deportation to work camps. The Franks were deported with the last transportation train to Auschwitz late 1944.</dd>
                    <dt>1942-1944</dt>
                    <dd>Anne Frank frequently wrote in her diary. In the beginning about the restrictions and discrimination the Jewish family faced by the Dutch Nazis, later about the relationships within her family and with the friends that joined them in their hiding place.</dd>

                    <dd>For her 13th birthday, Anne Frank got a notebook from her father, which she started to use as a diary. In July, the family went into hiding to prevent persecution and deportation into work camps. Their hiding place is known as <em>Achterhuis</em>. The hiding place was located above one of Otto's old companies, hidden by a bookcase. Only a handful employees of the company knew about the hidden family. They were joined by two befriended families by the end of the year.</dd>
