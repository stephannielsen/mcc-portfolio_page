                    <p>
                        C# is a strongly-typed language. Every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Every method signature specifies a type for each input parameter and for the return value. The .NET class library defines a set
                        of built-in numeric types as well as more complex types that represent a wide variety of logical constructs, such as the file system, network connections, collections and arrays of objects, and dates. A typical C# program uses
                        types from the class library as well as user-defined types that model the concepts that are specific to the program's problem domain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information stored in a type can include the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The storage space that a variable of the type requires.</li>
                            <li>The maximum and minimum values that it can represent.</li>
                            <li>The members (methods, fields, events, and so on) that it contains.</li>
                            <li>The base type it inherits from.</li>
                            <li>The location where the memory for variables will be allocated at run time.</li>
                            <li>The kinds of operations that are permitted.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The compiler uses type information to make sure that all operations that are performed in your code are <em>type safe</em>type safe. For example, if you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, the compiler allows you to use
                        the variable in addition and subtraction operations. If you try to perform those same operations on a variable of type <code>bool</code>, the compiler generates an error, as shown in the following example:
                        <pre><code class="block csharp">
int a = 5;             
int b = a + 2; //OK

bool test = true;
    
// Error. Operator '+' cannot be applied to operands of type 'int' and 'bool'.
int c = a + test;
                    </code></pre> The compiler embeds the type information into the executable file as metadata. The common language runtime (CLR) uses that metadata at run time to further guarantee type safety when it allocates
                        and reclaims memory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you declare a variable or constant in a program, you must either specify its type or use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type. The following example shows some variable declarations that use both built-in numeric types and complex user-defined
                        types:
                        <pre><code class="block csharp">
// Declaration only:
float temperature;
string name;
MyClass myClass;

// Declaration with initializers (four examples):
char firstLetter = 'C';
var limit = 3;
int[] source = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
var query = from item in source
            where item <= limit
            select item;
                                </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The types of method parameters and return values are specified in the method signature. The following signature shows a method that requires an int as an input argument and returns a string:
                        <pre><code class="block csharp">
public string GetName(int ID)
{
    if (ID < names.Length)
        return names[ID];
    else
        return String.Empty;
}
private string[] names = { "Spencer", "Sally", "Doug" };
                                        </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After a variable is declared, it cannot be re-declared with a new type, and it cannot be assigned a value that is not compatible with its declared type. For example, you cannot declare an <code>int</code> and then assign it a <code>Boolean</code>                        value of <code>true</code>. However, values can be converted to other types, for example when they are assigned to new variables or passed as method arguments. A type conversion that does not cause data loss is performed automatically
                        by the compiler. A conversion that might cause data loss requires a cast in the source code.
                    </p>

                        C# provides a standard set of built-in numeric types to represent integers, floating point values, Boolean expressions, text characters, decimal values, and other types of data. There are also built-in <code>string</code> and <code>object</code>                        types. These are available for you to use in any C# program. For more information about the built-in types, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/reference-tables-for-types">Reference Tables for Types</a>.

                        You use the struct, class, interface, and enum constructs to create your own custom types. The .NET class library itself is a collection of custom types provided by Microsoft that you can use in your own applications. By default, the most frequently used
                        types in the class library are available in any C# program. Others become available only when you explicitly add a project reference to the assembly in which they are defined. After the compiler has a reference to the assembly,
                        you can declare variables (and constants) of the types declared in that assembly in source code. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/class-library-overview">.NET Class Library</a>.

                    The Common Type System

                    <p>
                        It is important to understand two fundamental points about the type system in .NET:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                It supports the principle of inheritance. Types can derive from other types, called base types. The derived type inherits (with some restrictions) the methods, properties, and other members of the base type. The base type can in turn derive from some
                                other type, in which case the derived type inherits the members of both base types in its inheritance hierarchy. All types, including built-in numeric types such as <code>System.Int32</code>                                (C# keyword: <code>int</code>), derive ultimately from a single base type, which is <code>System.Object</code> (C# keyword: <code>object</code>). This unified type hierarchy is called the Common Type System (CTS). For more
                                information about inheritance in C#, see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance">Inheritance</a>.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Each type in the CTS is defined as either a <em>value type</em> or a <em>reference type</em>. This includes all custom types in the .NET class library and also your own user-defined types. Types that you define by using
                                the
                                <code>struct</code> keyword are value types; all the built-in numeric types are structs. Types that you define by using the <code>class</code> keyword are reference types. Reference types and value types have different
                                compile-time rules, and different run-time behavior.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The following illustration shows the relationship between value types and reference types in the CTS.
